            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src=assets\images\portfolio.png>
            <p>I was born in Esmeraldas, a small city in the coast of Ecuador. My childhood was filled with innumerable beach trips, good food, and a lot of dancing. After finishing high school, I moved to Quito to pursue my career in Eco-Tourism. College time was great, part of the curriculum was travelling, and that is what I loved the most. At the end of school, I had the opportunity to work with indigenous people in the Amazon region, this was one of the best experiences of my life.
                Ten years ago, I decided to leave my career as a “Dora the explorer” in training and started a new journey to technology. Now, I am lucky to have a job that I like, that allows me to “play” with a great variety of equipment at all time, and that keeps me motivated. Most of my work has been on networking, high-end storage systems, SANs, and deploying new lab environments. During all these years I have been thinking about ways to automate some of the processes and improve the efficiency of my team, and this is what brought me to my new adventure: The Coding Bootcamp.
